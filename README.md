# Udacity-React-Nanodegree-Project-3

Mobile Android application, built with React Native, that allows users to study
collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different

take quizzes on those decks.

This project encompasses the fundamental aspects of building a native
application including handling infinite lists, routing, and user input.
